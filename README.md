# C/C++ Shared Library for Common Collections Algorithm and Structures

This C/C++ shared library provides a collection of commonly used data structures and algorithms, including linked lists,
hash maps, and array lists. It allows you to efficiently manage and manipulate collections of data in your C/C++ projects.

## Features
- [x] Event / Event Bus for creating commands system
- [x] Linked lists implementations (Simple / Double Chained and Circular) for storing and traversing data in a dynamic manner
- [x] Hash map and Hash set implementation for fast key-value lookups and storage and traversing data in a dynamic maner
- [x] Chained (linked) Hash Tables, Open Addressing Hash tables for fast 
- [x] Heap & Stack implementations for LIFO / FIFO data organization
- [x] Data Sets implementations for storing unique values and traversing data in a dynamic manner
- [x] Deques / Queues implementations  for storing elements in the order they were added
- [ ] (Not released yet) Binary trees implementations for organizing and efficiently searching data
- [ ] (Not released yet) Graphs implementations for organizing and efficiently searching data
- [ ] (Not released ) Sort & Search Algorithms associated to data structures mentionned bellow
