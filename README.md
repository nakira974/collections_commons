# C Shared Library for Common Collections Algorithm and Structures

This C shared library provides a collection of commonly used data structures and algorithms, including linked lists,
hash maps, and array lists. It allows you to efficiently manage and manipulate collections of data in your C projects.

## Features

- [x] Linked lists implementations (Simple / Double Chained and Circular) for storing and traversing data in a dynamic manner
- [ ] (Not released yet) Hash map implementation for fast key-value lookups and storage
- [x] Binary trees implementations for organizing and efficiently searching data
- [x] Heap & Stack implementations for LIFO / FIFO data organization
- [x] Data Sets (Simple and Randomized) implementations for storing and traversing data in a dynamic manner
- [x] Deques / Queues (Simple, Priority) implementations  for storing elements in the order they were added
- [ ] (Not released yet) Graphs implementations for organizing and efficiently searching data
- [ ] (Not released ) Sort & Search Algorithms associated to data structures mentionned bellow

## Usage

To use this library in your C projects, simply include the appropriate header files and link against the shared library
during compilation. Detailed usage instructions and examples can be found in the [documentation](link/to/documentation).
