# C Shared Library for Common Collections Algorithm and Structures

This C shared library provides a collection of commonly used data structures and algorithms, including linked lists,
hash maps, and array lists. It allows you to efficiently manage and manipulate collections of data in your C projects.

## Features

- [x] Linked list implementation for storing and traversing data in a dynamic manner.
- [ ] (Not release yet) Hash map implementation for fast key-value lookups and storage.
- [ ] (Not release yet) Array list implementation for efficient random access and dynamic resizing.
- [x] Randomized set implementation for storing and traversing data in a dynamic manner.

## Usage

To use this library in your C projects, simply include the appropriate header files and link against the shared library
during compilation. Detailed usage instructions and examples can be found in the [documentation](link/to/documentation).
